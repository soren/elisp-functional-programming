Functional Programming in Emacs Lisp
------------------------------------

This repository contains some exercises/examples of functional programing in Emacs Lisp.

They are based on the Perl 6 code here: https://github.com/soren/perl6-functional-programming

You can run the examples from the command line like this:

    emacs -Q --batch --load script-name.el
